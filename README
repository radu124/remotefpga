Platform to allow running FPGA experiments remotely

INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

The entire folder has to be placed somwhere it can be served using a HTTP server
(for example Apache) and this server must support php.

Make sure that the
spool/
 and
admin/
 directories are not readable from the web (that the .htaccess are in effect 
 - this is disabled in newer versions of Apache)

New requests from users are stored as separate directories in the spool directory.

The bitspooler.py program in the spool/ directory must be run there with proper rights
to both read/write the newly created directories (must run as www-data) and you must
make sure it has the right to configure the fpga board and to read the TTY
(in Ubuntu add the user to the "dialout" group) - Digilent boards are accessible by 
default, after the Digilent Adept software has been installed.

CONFIGURATION
=============
The user names and passwords are found in plain text in the admin folder (this is why it
is important for this folder to be inaccessible via web). Depending on your setup you
may want to move this somewhere else. If you do this you need to specify the new location
in settings.php.

The users (and passwords) file (default: admin/users.txt) lists one user on each line,
followed by one space, followed by the password.

USAGE
=====

When both the web-server and the bitspooler.py are running simply access the web-page,
provide the design that you want uploaded, fill-in your user-name and password, choose
a board type (if more options are available) and a baud rate and click Submit.

A web-page displaying status will refresh every few seconds, then the output from the
serial port is returned as a download.
